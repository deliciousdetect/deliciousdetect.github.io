      <description>&lt;p&gt;Always on the lookout for the best food experiences, my search brought me to
Orlando, Florida of all places. On a gorgeous May evening I arrived to one of
the best food truck rodeos I&amp;rsquo;d experienced in a long time! #TastyTuesday! Three
cool bars are all next to each other and they have a large variety of craft beer
and cocktails to enjoy with whatever food trucks catch your eye in the back
parking lot. I highly recommend checking this out if you are in Orlando or
visiting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search for &amp;ldquo;Tasty Tuesdays in the Milk District&amp;rdquo; on Facebook to find
the upcoming schedule and location. Just remember all the action is hidden
in the back, so don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you are in the right place. You will have a
great time!&lt;/p&gt;
