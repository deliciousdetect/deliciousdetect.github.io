&lt;p&gt;I stopped by the Beer Junction on a cold and rainy night to see what they were pouring&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-beers-fall-line-russian-imperial-stout:5354f2e796547a35da65b6d858d932e0&#34;&gt;Two Beers Fall Line Russian Imperial Stout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12% ABV&lt;br /&gt;
This is a great beer if you want something strong, smooth and dark. Very solid flavor. Would order again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stone-brewing-americano-stout:5354f2e796547a35da65b6d858d932e0&#34;&gt;Stone Brewing Americano Stout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.7% ABV&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll need a few sips to let this one settle on your palate. Once you are warmed up though, if you are
seeking an espresso / coffee flavor, this is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-magnets-old-skook-in-the-woods-barley-wine:5354f2e796547a35da65b6d858d932e0&#34;&gt;Three Magnets Old Skook in the Woods Barley Wine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.5%&lt;br /&gt;
This is a pretty tasty barley wine. Especially considering the ABV&amp;hellip; There is not a lot going on flavor wise,
but I think that BJ is pouring this one a little bit too cold, if I may be honest. I&amp;rsquo;m generally a
fan of barley wine and have a preference for the releases that Fremont has put out in recent times.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently heard about Three Magnets, and this is my first experience with any of their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
