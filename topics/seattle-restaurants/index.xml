      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a joint upstairs in the infamous Bellevue Square Mall. You have to enter
from the street on Bellevue Way, which makes it seem less &amp;ldquo;mall-ey.” I think I
just made up a word. You walk up some winding stair cases until you see some
windows. On the other side of said windows, it kind of looks like a scene from
an old 40’s movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My visit was during late lunch time. Their black bean burger was really good.
I don’t really like the vibe of this place, however, the bar top made of pennies
is really cool. The craft beer selection was pretty decent for a restaurant/bar
adjacent to a giant mall. The bartender was very cool. He told me that it turns
into a club or something night club&amp;rsquo;ish on the weekends. I think I just made up
another word again. I can’t even imagine who shows up to this place in the evening.
Perhaps it’s nicer than I’m imagining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line:
Come here for the food and drinks, not the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been going to this place for years, and I love it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that’s about all I can say because I love it so much. I can not risk having any
bearded hipsters overrunning this place!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This medium size coffee shop in Kirkland deserves a special mention. They have
a lot of places to sit solo, or with a friend, and the wifi is really good too.
I only had one coffee there during my visit, but I really liked it. I also had
some food, which was surprisingly good for a coffee shop. The staff was really
helpful and friendly anytime I needed something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for the best coffee shop in Kirkland, this is probably it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Damn The Weather</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time in October 2014 I checked out Damn the Weather in Seattle’s Pioneer
Square. This was obviously before it was featured as a &amp;ldquo;Best new restaurant&amp;rdquo;
in Seattle Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know:
The ice cubes there are from another planet. They are melted from the bottom up,
I shit you not. These cubes will make your cocktail experience one to remember
for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food:
I had the sandwich with the egg placed into the bread itself. You want this.
Grilled romaine salad was pretty Damn Tasty too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was feeling hungry and adventurous, so after we left here we set out for
Kedai Makan on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
