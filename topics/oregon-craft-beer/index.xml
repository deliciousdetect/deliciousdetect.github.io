&lt;p&gt;I stopped by the 


&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://www.thebeerjunction.com&#34;&gt;Beer Junction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-external-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;


 on a cold and rainy
night to see what they were pouring. Here we go&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-beers-fall-line-russian-imperial-stout:5354f2e796547a35da65b6d858d932e0&#34;&gt;Two Beers Fall Line Russian Imperial Stout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12% ABV&lt;br /&gt;
This is a great beer if you want something strong, smooth and dark. Very solid flavor. Would order again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stone-brewing-americano-stout:5354f2e796547a35da65b6d858d932e0&#34;&gt;Stone Brewing Americano Stout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.7% ABV&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll need a few sips to let this one settle on your palate. Once you are warmed up though, if you are
seeking an espresso / coffee flavor, this is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-magnets-old-skook-in-the-woods-barley-wine:5354f2e796547a35da65b6d858d932e0&#34;&gt;Three Magnets Old Skook in the Woods Barley Wine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.5%&lt;br /&gt;
This is a pretty tasty barley wine. Especially considering the ABV&amp;hellip; There is not a lot going on flavor wise,
but I think that BJ is pouring this one a little bit too cold, if I may be honest. I&amp;rsquo;m generally a
fan of barley wine and have a preference for the releases that Fremont has put out in recent times.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently heard about Three Magnets, and this is my first experience with any of their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boneyard Beer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first visit to Boneyard Beer in Bend! I finally made it!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://instagram.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/12071229_545381622286097_187417345_n.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have been enjoying Boneyard Beer for several years now, but a visit to the brewery itself has thus
far evaded me. I corrected that today&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed several tasters samples and some great conversation with a few locals and visitors. The main
point of my visit was to try anything that I could not find anywhere else, but more importantly get
receive the infamous BONEYARD stamp in my Delicious notebook. This was a pretty big deal for me because
so almost all brewing operations today have stamps for people on Ale Trails, etc. But their stamps are
usually so small!! I&amp;rsquo;m guessing this is to accommodate the various passports and maps in some manner
that is legible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally the producers of some of the best beers you can find anywhere are not interested in keeping
up with the Jones&amp;rsquo; when it comes to the size of their stamp!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Bend</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending some time in Eastern Washington again, I decided that a trip to Bend was needed.
I had not been to Bend since NW Demo Days at Mt. Bachelor in February, and I barely got to spend any time in town on my last trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived in town, I went immediately to Crux Fermentation Project and somehow
ended up with two flights of beer over the course of a couple hours.&lt;/p&gt;
