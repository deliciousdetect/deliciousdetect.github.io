&lt;h1 id=&#34;march-9th-2016:5354f2e796547a35da65b6d858d932e0&#34;&gt;March 9th, 2016&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Delicious Detector&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped by the 


&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://www.thebeerjunction.com&#34;&gt;Beer Junction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-external-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;


 on a cold and rainy
night to see what they were pouring. Here we go&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-magnets-old-skook-in-the-woods-barley-wine:5354f2e796547a35da65b6d858d932e0&#34;&gt;Three Magnets - Old Skook in the Woods Barley Wine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olympia, WA&lt;br /&gt;
12.5%&lt;br /&gt;
This is a pretty tasty barley wine. Especially considering the ABV&amp;hellip; There is not a lot going on flavor wise,
but I think that BJ is pouring this one a little bit too cold, if I&amp;rsquo;m being totally honest. I&amp;rsquo;m generally a
fan of barley wine and have a preference for the releases that Fremont has put out in recent times.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently heard about Three Magnets, and this is my first experience with any of their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-beers-fall-line-russian-imperial-stout:5354f2e796547a35da65b6d858d932e0&#34;&gt;Two Beers - Fall Line Russian Imperial Stout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seattle, WA&lt;br /&gt;
12% ABV&lt;br /&gt;
This is a great beer if you want something strong, smooth and dark. Very solid flavor. Would order again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stone-brewing-americano-stout:5354f2e796547a35da65b6d858d932e0&#34;&gt;Stone Brewing - Americano Stout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escondido, Calif.&lt;br /&gt;
8.7% ABV&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll need a few sips to let this one settle on your palate. Once you are warmed up though, if you are
seeking an espresso / coffee flavor, this is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Black Hammer Brewing</title>

        &lt;img src=&#34;https://instagram.fsjc1-3.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/12677459_957590344325377_1792762794_n.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;


&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://blackhammerbrewing.com/&#34;&gt;Black Hammer Brewing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-external-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;


 is a newer entry to the San Francisco Craft Beer scene. I made sure to check them out
during my visit, and I&amp;rsquo;m really glad that I did! Black Hammer is affiliated with 


&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://www.pacbrewlab.com&#34;&gt;Pacific Brewing Laboratory.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-external-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that at time of writing in November 2015, their brews are brewed in 


&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nevada&amp;#43;City,&amp;#43;CA&amp;#43;95959/@39.1650308,-121.3944321,9z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x809b7a7134408b49:0x37bfaa9a5ce0c3cd&#34;&gt;Nevada City, CA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-external-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;



north of Sacramento. Black Hammer is waiting for the natural gas to be hooked up in this location at Bryant Street/Zoe Street in San Francisco when I visited. However, this location has been open for about three months now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bartender, &amp;ldquo;Scooter&amp;rdquo; was a really friendly guy and no joke, could pass for John Lennon easily.
The tap room had a cool vibe that reminded me subtly of some tap rooms in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the art they had displayed on all the walls too. A really nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasting-notes:27cd252afa64e409ff89656819f18cfd&#34;&gt;Tasting Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hopportunistic #2&lt;/strong&gt; - 6.2% 34IBU&lt;br /&gt;
Citra dry hopped Extra Pale Ale&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is a good beer!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whipnose Imperial IPA&lt;/strong&gt; - 10% 88IBU&lt;br /&gt;
From Pacific Brewing Laboratory&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A solid effort, would order again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serendipitous Stout&lt;/strong&gt; - 7.7% 35IBU&lt;br /&gt;
Vanilla Chocolate Stout&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Seems like more vanilla than chocolate, though a tasty beer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bock Party&lt;/strong&gt; - 8.2% 23IBU&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Different take on a bock, but good!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nautilus Hibiscus Saison&lt;/strong&gt; - 5.3% 18IBU&lt;br /&gt;
From Pacific Brewing Laboratory&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a saison, but I still gave it shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts:27cd252afa64e409ff89656819f18cfd&#34;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in the area and looking for a cool place with something tasty that is not 21st Amendment, you should
check out Black Hammer. I have a feeling that their quality, which is already good, is going to go up when they start
brewing in their SoMa location here, so give them a shot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cheers,&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Local Brewing Co</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since I was staying in the SoMa neighborhood of San Francisco, I decided to go for a walk to checkout a few places,
including &lt;a href=&#34;http://deliciousdetector.com/drink/black-hammer-brewing/&#34;&gt;Black Hammer Brewing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://deliciousdetector.com/drink/21st-Ammendment-Brewing&#34;&gt;21st Amendment Brewing&lt;/a&gt;
and here, 


&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://localbrewingco.com&#34;&gt;Local Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-external-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;



The beer was pretty good and the space was large and amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tasting-samples:33f7fcc8e623add248f5693da97aab2f&#34;&gt;Tasting Samples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sutro Tower Stout 5.9% 59IBU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parklet ISA 4.7% 61IBU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indian Summer Oktober Fest 6.3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1776 India Black Lager 7.8% 73IBU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boomtown Brown 4.1% 23IBU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crooked Amber 5.6% 30IBU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;additional-thoughts:33f7fcc8e623add248f5693da97aab2f&#34;&gt;Additional Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Brewery seems like it&amp;rsquo;s an adjustment from the what the neighborhood has been like lately.
There is a &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; indoor sports center across the street, and I heard that it&amp;rsquo;s been sold recently.
Inevitably, the city block that the sports center comprises will most likely become street level retail
with condos or apartments above. This brewery is placed in perhaps the best location for such a development.
Though I&amp;rsquo;m sure that some in the neighborhood are not happy about this, such is progress&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what took me so long to make it to Mamnoon on Capitol Hill! I really enjoyed the food
and ambience here. Several menu items and a bottle of white wine were shared. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in going back
for the things we were not able to try for sure. I&amp;rsquo;ve also heard about their late night counter window
but never tried it out. This is something that I might do to hold me over until I do another proper visit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a nice coffee shop in Hood River, Oregon with high ceilings, and plenty
of indoor and outdoor seating. The wifi is strong and plenty fast enough for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s even right next to a sweet water fountain that dogs and kids like to cool off
in on hot days. Check out this place if you are looking for a good coffee
shop experience in Hood River.
Doppio is right next to the Hood River Distillery tasting room. The tasting room
was still being built out when I was there so it was not open for business yet.
Something to check out on my next visit to Hood River!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kin - Hood River</title>
      <link>http://deliciousdetector.com/food/kin-hood-river/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr:5ead158d91f9a411526b4a6a278c5072&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch out for new restaurant kinks here, especially around the service. Getting
good waitstaff in small towns is harder than good chefs. Be prepared for great
food, but questionable timing around your meal.
With a little polish, Kin will be a force to contend with in a town more known
for wind-boarding and breweries, rather than expertly prepared food and service&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-review:5ead158d91f9a411526b4a6a278c5072&#34;&gt;Main Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that Delicious Detector seeks out positive experiences as much as possible,
but aims to be transparent with regards to actual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off this post, Kin is a new Hood River joint that just opened in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space is very nice, and they put some effort into the decor. Stepping into Kin
and hearing CCR on the sound system was giving me a really good vibe. I love CCR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was only one server on a holiday weekend Sunday brunch service. It was around
10am, so this was not shocking, as things might be winding down. However, service
was pretty slow, so I was alarmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked no questions about the menu, I was really hungry too. When she brought some
water by I was ready to order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered two items:
* Waffle
* French toast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not think the above would overwhelm our server, or anyone for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a run down of the brunch experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the waffle came out. We patiently waited for the French toast to follow.
When the chef commented that she was happy to see us eat all the grapes and blueberries
we replied that they were really good. She explained that some guests have been leaving
some of the fruit on the plate. I let her know that fruit is my thing, and that I’m
always looking for more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then said we were looking forward to the French toast as well. Going off her
reaction, it was clear that our French toast was not even started to be prepared yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our server explained to us that the kitchen had misread her ticket. I think that
was BS. I’m not sure I saw her write anything down in my presence, so who knows
what really happened. I was really hungry, so I blacked out a few details during this mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I find that unacceptable for I define as a slow Sunday morning at 10am.
Morning cobwebs in your head or not, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to screw up an order with only two items
and no modifications, but somehow this crew managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only that kept us from paying and leaving when our French toast did not come
out was Creedance Clearwater Revival on shuffle play interspersed with other more current tunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waffle was fabulous. Very little syrup, and it seemed like pretty good quality
syrup, though maybe grade A. Grade B is the only way to go if you want real flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French toast was actually on a French Roll, probably from the fabulous Knead
Bakery next store. A little crunchier than I prefer but it was good and I was
happy to get more of that good fruit!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First visit to Tray, a new restaurant in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. The food and service were
note worthy here. The tray concept is fun, if not cute. Come here for the food and service, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry
about the trays.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a decent Thai place on 15th Ave east on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh rolls were really good and peanut sauce was tasty as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garlic noodles were done satisfactorily. plenty of garlic for sure. They serve with peas and carrots
which is different than I&amp;rsquo;m used too. Did not seem like spice level 4 despite clearly ordering it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would eat here again based on this limited experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service was incredibly good for a neighborhood Thai joint. I was impressed with how attentive all the
service staff was for a place that visibly does a lot of take out business. The inside seating was
mostly empty on this gorgeous day which could account for the great service too. Of course we were
sitting outside on the sidewalk tables on a gorgeous July day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boneyard Beer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first visit to Boneyard Beer in Bend! I finally made it!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://instagram.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/12071229_545381622286097_187417345_n.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have been enjoying Boneyard Beer for several years now, but a visit to the brewery itself has thus
far evaded me. I corrected that today&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed several tasters samples and some great conversation with a few locals and visitors. The main
point of my visit was to try anything that I could not find anywhere else, but more importantly receive
the infamous &lt;strong&gt;BONEYARD&lt;/strong&gt; stamp in my Delicious notebook. This was a pretty big deal for me because
so almost all brewing operations today have stamps for people on Ale Trails, etc. But their stamps are
usually so small!! I&amp;rsquo;m guessing this is to accommodate the various passports and maps in some manner
that is legible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally the producers of some of the best beers you can find anywhere are not interested in keeping
up with the Jones&amp;rsquo; when it comes to the size of their stamp!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had my first lunch today at Wild Rose Northern Thai Eats. That place is awesome
and it was packed. I had the Khao Soi Curry. Really good stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m now at Crows
Feet Commons, and just finished my second lunch, a turkey and avocado sandwich on an Ocean Roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting here on the back patio staring out at the Deschutes River while my
dog lounges at my feet. Perfection. This is a classic place to visit here in Bend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crows Feet is the ultimate hybrid, and I&amp;rsquo;m in love with this place. They serve coffee,
craft beer, sandwiches, and even have a bicycle shop that sells accessories!
Now is a good time to mention that I need more places like Crows Feet in my life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just met some long distance bicyclists as well. They needed some supplies for their ride
and knew this would be a good place to stop. They left Eugene, Oregon yesterday morning
and just arrived in Bend a few moments ago. Their plan is to keep riding east this summer
until they get too tired or the weather stops cooperating. The current goal for them
is Chicago, but they might shoot for Boston!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While in Bend I made sure to check out Wild Rose Northen Thai Eats for lunch.
The place was full even at 12:30. I was lucky to find a seat at the bar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had their most well known lunch item, Khao Soi Curry. Egg noodles red onion and
pickled cabbage in a coconut curry broth topped with fried crispy egg noodles,
cilantro and lime. I had it with the tofu and it was really good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really recommend Wild Rose if you are in Bend.&lt;/p&gt;
