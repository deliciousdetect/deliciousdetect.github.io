      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first visit to Boneyard Beer in Bend! I finally made it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been enjoying Boneyard Beer for several years now, but a visit to the brewery itself has thus
far evaded me. I corrected that today&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed several tasters samples and some great conversation with a few locals and visitors. The main
point of my visit was to try anything that I could not find anywhere else, but more importantly receive
the infamous &lt;strong&gt;BONEYARD&lt;/strong&gt; stamp in my Delicious notebook. This was a pretty big deal for me because
so almost all brewing operations today have stamps for people on Ale Trails, etc. But their stamps are
usually so small!! I&amp;rsquo;m guessing this is to accommodate the various passports and maps in some manner
that is legible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally the producers of some of the best beers you can find anywhere are not interested in keeping
up with the Jones&amp;rsquo; when it comes to the size of their stamp!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had my first lunch today at Wild Rose Northern Thai Eats. That place is awesome
and it was packed. I had the Khao Soi Curry. Really good stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m now at Crows
Feet Commons, and just finished my second lunch, a turkey and avocado sandwich on an Ocean Roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting here on the back patio staring out at the Deschutes River while my
dog lounges at my feet. Perfection. This is a classic place to visit here in Bend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crows Feet is the ultimate hybrid, and I&amp;rsquo;m in love with this place. They serve coffee,
craft beer, sandwiches, and even have a bicycle shop that sells accessories!
Now is a good time to mention that I need more places like Crows Feet in my life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just met some long distance bicyclists as well. They needed some supplies for their ride
and knew this would be a good place to stop. They left Eugene, Oregon yesterday morning
and just arrived in Bend a few moments ago. Their plan is to keep riding east this summer
until they get too tired or the weather stops cooperating. The current goal for them
is Chicago, but they might shoot for Boston!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wild Rose - Northern Thai Eats</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While in Bend I made sure to check out Wild Rose Northen Thai Eats for lunch.
The place was full even at 12:30. I was lucky to find a seat at the bar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had their most well known lunch item, Khao Soi Curry. Egg noodles red onion and
pickled cabbage in a coconut curry broth topped with fried crispy egg noodles,
cilantro and lime. I had it with the tofu and it was really good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really recommend Wild Rose if you are in Bend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Bend</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending some time in Eastern Washington again, I decided that a trip to Bend was needed.
I had not been to Bend since NW Demo Days at Mt. Bachelor in February, and I barely got to spend any time in town on my last trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived in town, I went immediately to Crux Fermentation Project and somehow
ended up with two flights of beer over the course of a couple hours.&lt;/p&gt;
