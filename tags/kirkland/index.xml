      <description>&lt;p&gt;This medium size coffee shop in Kirkland deserves a special mention. They have
a lot of places to sit solo, or with a friend, and the wifi is really good too.
I only had one coffee there during my visit, but I really liked it. I also had
some food, which was surprisingly good for a coffee shop. The staff was really
helpful and friendly anytime I needed something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for the best coffee shop in Kirkland, this is probably it.&lt;/p&gt;
