      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what took me so long to make it to Mamnoon on Capitol Hill! I really enjoyed the food
and ambience here. Several menu items and a bottle of white wine were shared. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in going back
for the things we were not able to try for sure. I&amp;rsquo;ve also heard about their late night counter window
but never tried it out. This is something that I might do to hold me over until I do another proper visit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a decent Thai place on 15th Ave east on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh rolls were really good and peanut sauce was tasty as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garlic noodles were done satisfactorily. plenty of garlic for sure. They serve with peas and carrots
which is different than I&amp;rsquo;m used too. Did not seem like spice level 4 despite clearly ordering it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would eat here again based on this limited experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service was incredibly good for a neighborhood Thai joint. I was impressed with how attentive all the
service staff was for a place that visibly does a lot of take out business. The inside seating was
mostly empty on this gorgeous day which could account for the great service too. Of course we were
sitting outside on the sidewalk tables on a gorgeous July day.&lt;/p&gt;
