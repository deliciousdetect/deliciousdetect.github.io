      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first visit to Boneyard Beer in Bend! I finally made it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been enjoying Boneyard Beer for several years now, but a visit to the brewery itself has thus
far evaded me. I corrected that today&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed several tasters samples and some great conversation with a few locals and visitors. The main
point of my visit was to try anything that I could not find anywhere else, but more importantly receive
the infamous &lt;strong&gt;BONEYARD&lt;/strong&gt; stamp in my Delicious notebook. This was a pretty big deal for me because
almost all brewing operations today have stamps for people on Ale Trails, etc. But their stamps are
usually so small!! I&amp;rsquo;m guessing this is to accommodate the various passports and maps in some manner
that is legible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally the producers of some of the best beers you can find anywhere are not interested in keeping
up with the Jones&amp;rsquo; when it comes to the size of their stamp!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep Rockin&amp;rsquo;!!&lt;/p&gt;
