      <title>Doppio - Hood River</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a nice coffee shop in Hood River, Oregon with high ceilings, and plenty
of indoor and outdoor seating. The wifi is strong and plenty fast enough for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s even right next to a sweet water fountain that dogs and kids like to cool off
in on hot days. Check out this place if you are looking for a good coffee
shop experience in Hood River.
Doppio is right next to the Hood River Distillery tasting room. The tasting room
was still being built out when I was there so it was not open for business yet.
Something to check out on my next visit to Hood River!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kin - Hood River</title>
      <link>http://deliciousdetector.com/food/kin-hood-river/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Watch out for new restaurant kinks here, especially around the service. Getting
good waitstaff in small towns is harder than good chefs. Be prepared for great
food, but questionable timing around your meal.
With a little polish, Kin will be a force to contend with in a town more known
for wind-boarding and breweries, rather than expertly prepared food and service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that Delicious Detector seeks out positive experiences as much as possible,
but aims to be transparent with regards to actual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off this post, Kin is a new Hood River joint that just opened in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space is very nice, and they put some effort into the decor. Stepping into Kin
and hearing CCR on the sound system was giving me a really good vibe. I love CCR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was only one server on a holiday weekend Sunday brunch service. It was around
10am, so this was not shocking, as things might be winding down. However, service
was pretty slow, so I was alarmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked no questions about the menu, I was really hungry too. When she brought some
water by I was ready to order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered two items:
* Waffle
* French toast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not think the above would overwhelm our server, or anyone for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a run down of the brunch experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the waffle came out. We patiently waited for the French toast to follow.
When the chef commented that she was happy to see us eat all the grapes and blueberries
we replied that they were really good. She explained that some guests have been leaving
some of the fruit on the plate. I let her know that fruit is my thing, and that I’m
always looking for more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then said we were looking forward to the French toast as well. Going off her
reaction, it was clear that our French toast was not even started to be prepared yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our server explained to us that the kitchen had misread her ticket. I think that
was BS. I’m not sure I saw her write anything down in my presence, so who knows
what really happened. I was really hungry, so I blacked out a few details during this mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I find that unacceptable for I define as a slow Sunday morning at 10am.
Morning cobwebs in your head or not, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to screw up an order with only two items
and no modifications, but somehow this crew managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only that kept us from paying and leaving when our French toast did not come
out was Creedance Clearwater Revival on shuffle play interspersed with other more current tunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waffle was fabulous. Very little syrup, and it seemed like pretty good quality
syrup, though maybe grade A. Grade B is the only way to go if you want real flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French toast was actually on a French Roll, probably from the fabulous Knead
Bakery next store. A little crunchier than I prefer but it was good and I was
happy to get more of that good fruit!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had my first lunch today at Wild Rose Northern Thai Eats. That place is awesome
and it was packed. I had the Khao Soi Curry. Really good stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m now at Crows
Feet Commons, and just finished my second lunch, a turkey and avocado sandwich on an Ocean Roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting here on the back patio staring out at the Deschutes River while my
dog lounges at my feet. Perfection. This is a classic place to visit here in Bend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crows Feet is the ultimate hybrid, and I&amp;rsquo;m in love with this place. They serve coffee,
craft beer, sandwiches, and even have a bicycle shop that sells accessories!
Now is a good time to mention that I need more places like Crows Feet in my life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just met some long distance bicyclists as well. They needed some supplies for their ride
and knew this would be a good place to stop. They left Eugene, Oregon yesterday morning
and just arrived in Bend a few moments ago. Their plan is to keep riding east this summer
until they get too tired or the weather stops cooperating. The current goal for them
is Chicago, but they might shoot for Boston!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While in Bend I made sure to check out Wild Rose Northen Thai Eats for lunch.
The place was full even at 12:30. I was lucky to find a seat at the bar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had their most well known lunch item, Khao Soi Curry. Egg noodles red onion and
pickled cabbage in a coconut curry broth topped with fried crispy egg noodles,
cilantro and lime. I had it with the tofu and it was really good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really recommend Wild Rose if you are in Bend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending some time in Eastern Washington again, I decided that a trip to Bend was needed.
I had not been to Bend since NW Demo Days at Mt. Bachelor in February, and I barely got to spend any time in town on my last trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived in town, I went immediately to Crux Fermentation Project and somehow
ended up with two flights of beer over the course of a couple hours.&lt;/p&gt;
