      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what took me so long to make it to Mamnoon on Capitol Hill! I really enjoyed the food
and ambience here. Several menu items and a bottle of white wine were shared. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in going back
for the things we were not able to try for sure. I&amp;rsquo;ve also heard about their late night counter window
but never tried it out. This is something that I might do to hold me over until I do another proper visit.&lt;/p&gt;
